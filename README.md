# SimplePlugin
A simple plugin for intellij platform. This is the demo project from  http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/custom_language_support 


Thanks to [Cheptsov](https://github.com/cheptsov).


Note. Since the original project has gone, the icon provided in this copy is different from the Tutorials. By the way, the extension is modified to 'tencent' for test. It doesn't hurt to change this to whatever you want.
